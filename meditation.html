						<b>Meditations in Kundalini Yoga</b> and have releasing and healing results. During meditation, you can feel entirely awakened, heightened, and moved by the energy you’re releasing or creating. The meditations in Kundalini yoga are practiced at specific lengths to achieve different results. A 3-minute meditation affects the electromagnetic field and circulation of blood in the body, while an 11-minute meditation begins to alter the nervous and glandular systems of the body. A 31-minute meditation affects all cells, rhythms of the body, and clears out the subconscious mind.<br/><br/>
						<b>How to do this Kundalini meditation:</b><br/><br/>
						Sit comfortably with legs crossed and your spine straight. Place your palms together in prayer pose at the center of the chest with the fingers pointing up.<br/><br/>
						With eyes closed, you’ll focus your gaze at the brow point where your third eye or 6th chakra is located which is the point between your eyebrows and up a bit.<br/><br/>
						Your breath will be divided into four equal parts as you inhale.<br/><br/>
						After you breathe in four equal parts, you will hold the breath and exhale, breaking the outgoing breath again into four equal parts and then hold out for a few seconds.<br/><br/>
						On each inhale and exhale, pull your navel point toward your spine. Each breath cycles takes about 7-8 seconds.<br/><br/>
						This meditation is best practiced for 3-5 minutes. We love to add the mantra Sa Ta Na Ma to this meditation, and we encourage you to play this mantra if your mind is anxious or your thoughts are distracting you. Sa Ta Na Ma means “Infinity, Life, Death, and Rebirth.” This mantra will help you focus your mind and ultimately connects you to your highest and most true self.<br/><br/>
						<b>Kundalini: What You Need to Know About Mudras</b><br/><br/>
						Mudras are hand positions that lock and direct energy into different parts of our brains. Thousands of years ago, yogis mapped out the hands and how they are connected to different parts of the brain and body through specific hand placement. We always use a finger to finger placement and press down to activate the energy.<br/>
